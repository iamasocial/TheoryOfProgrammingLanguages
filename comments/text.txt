{[Intro: $lick $loth]}
Ayy, ayy, ayy

{[Verse 1: $lick $loth & Ruby da Cherry]}
Tell me #what you know 'bout a motherfucker out the bottom
With a gold #grill gleamin', makin' all these hoes problems
Stalker, creepin' out the fuckin' dungeon
Switchblade on 'em, hit the guts like a pumpkin, dumpin'
Thirty rounds {off {the{ clip,} off} rip}
Too thick with the stick, bet I won't miss
Lil $lick real sick, don't talk shit
Whip, whip, like a brick scale on fish (Hahahaha, ha, ha, ha)
Suicide{, night time, no, we don't fight crime, oh} (Ha, ha)
It's the Grey*59{ with the real red eyes, and we dyin' inside, ooh (Ha, ha)
Bodies in fluoride, let the rope untie, just crucify me (Ha, ha)
Yung Christ wrists sliced, couple hoes on ice, singin',} "RIP" (Ruby)

{[Verse 2: Ruby da Cherry]}
Ruby was a {motherfucking} reject
Then I cut my wrists, and now I motherfucking bleed checks
Still broke after all the motherfucking weed gets rolled
Hoes askin' if I see a ghost, tell 'em, "No
I just seep smoke when the weed blown"
She choke from the deep-throat, three feet of rope, lethal
Slay the fuckin' sheep, so evil, I'ma hang myself
And then I get to see home, Ruby a fucking demon (Hahahaha, ayy, uh)
Ruby got a cult now, hoes tryna bolt down
Ruby the result of a reject from a small town
Turned into a demon, I'm evolved now
Loud growl, $now Leopard on the prowl (Ayy)
Stay the fuck back}, ho, slay the whole pack, ho
Paint the globe black, ho (Ayy)
Soon I will shed this skin, turn to the devil
Then I'll never reminisce (Ayy)
